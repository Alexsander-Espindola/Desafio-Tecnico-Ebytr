### Backend Architecture

We decided to follow some MSC to guide our backend architecture. Here is a quick glance of what we expect when of new contributions in the backend project. How we organize our project:

- `/back-end/src`: Source of all back-end;
  - `controller`: Is the layer that takes care of http requests to the server;
  - `service`: Is the layer that takes care of the application's business rules, it intermediates the information coming from the route to the model;
  - `model`: Is the layer that governs all the database, connections and queries;
  - `middleware`: Is a type of controller, but can be reused for authentication or error handling functions for example;
  - `routes`: This layer will tell which endpoint will operate for each controller;
  - `server`: Here our server is instantiated and identifies the routes and entities;
  - `test`: This layer makes everything, including coffee;

### Frontend Architecture


 - `public`: This layer has all the static files of the system made available by http;
 - `src`: Source of all front-end code;
   - `api`: This layer has all fetch into your API using axios;
   - `app`: This layer are a redux and yours slices;
   - `assets`: This layers concentrate your styles and images;
   - `components`: Here our components are stored so they can be reused;
   - `pages`: Folder responsible for storing system pages;
   - `test`: This layer makes everything, including coffee;
