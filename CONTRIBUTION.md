### Backend Architecture

We decided to follow some MSC to guide our backend architecture. Here is a quick glance of what we expect when of new contributions in the backend project. How we organize our project:

- `src`: source of all project;
  - `controller`: is the layer that takes care of http requests to the server;
  - `service`: is the layer that takes care of the application's business rules, it intermediates the information coming from the route to the model;
  - `model`: is the layer that governs all the database, connections and queries;
  - `middleware`: is a type of controller, but can be reused for authentication or error handling functions for example;
  - `routes`: this layer will tell which endpoint will operate for each controller;
  - `server`: here our server is instantiated and identifies the routes and entities;
  - `test`: this layer makes everything, including coffee;

Thanks ❤️
